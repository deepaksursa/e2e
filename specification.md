# E2E Automation Framework Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and specifications for an end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework using Python, Pytest, and Playwright. The framework is designed to provide a robust, maintainable, and scalable solution for automated testing across different environments.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (Latest version)
- **Test Framework**: Pytest (Latest version)
- **UI Automation Tool**: Playwright (Latest version)
- **Reporting Tool**: Allure Reports
- **Version Control**: Git

## Core Dependencies
- `pytest` - Test runner and framework
- `playwright` - Browser automation library
- `pytest-playwright` - Pytest plugin for Playwright
- `allure-pytest` - Test reporting
- `pytest-xdist` - Parallel test execution
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `pytest-html` - HTML report generation (alternative to Allure)

## Key Features and Requirements

### 1. Test Organization and Execution
- **Feature-based Organization**: Tests should be organized by features or modules
- **Independent Test Cases**: Each test should be independently executable
- **Parallel Execution**: Support for running tests in parallel to reduce execution time
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Headless Mode**: Support for headless browser execution in CI/CD pipelines
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for flaky tests
- **Tagging**: Allow test classification with tags/markers for selective execution

### 2. Page Object Model
- **Abstraction Layer**: Implement Page Object Model to separate test logic from UI interactions
- **Reusable Components**: Create reusable UI components for common elements (e.g., navigation, forms)
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate web elements and their interactions within appropriate page objects
- **Playwright Integration**: Utilize Playwright's capabilities for robust element selection and interaction

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Environment Management**: Support for different environments (DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD)
- **Configuration Files**: External configuration files for environment-specific settings
- **Browser Configuration**: Options to configure browser instances (viewport, user agent, etc.)
- **Credentials Management**: Secure handling of test credentials
- **Command-line Options**: Support for runtime configuration via command-line parameters

### 4. Test Data Management
- **External Data Sources**: Support for data-driven testing using external files (JSON, CSV, YAML)
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Utilities for generating test data on-the-fly
- **Fixture Parametrization**: Use Pytest fixtures for test data parametrization
- **Data Cleanup**: Mechanisms for test data cleanup after test execution

### 5. Reporting
- **Allure Reports**: Primary reporting tool with detailed test execution information
- **Screenshots**: Automatic screenshots on test failures
- **Video Recording**: Optional video recording of test execution
- **Logs**: Comprehensive logging of test actions and events
- **Historical Results**: Support for tracking test results over time
- **Dashboard**: Visual representation of test metrics and trends

### 6. CI/CD Integration
- **Pipeline Integration**: Easy integration with CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- **Docker Support**: Containerized execution capability
- **Scheduled Execution**: Support for scheduled test runs
- **Notification System**: Integration with notification services (email, Slack, etc.)

### 7. Error Handling and Debugging
- **Explicit Waits**: Smart waiting mechanisms for UI elements
- **Error Screenshots**: Automatic capturing of screenshots on failures
- **Detailed Logs**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Trace Collection**: Playwright trace files for failure analysis

### 8. Authentication and Security
- **Login Workflows**: Support for different authentication workflows
- **Session Management**: Efficient handling of user sessions
- **Secure Storage**: Secure storage of sensitive test data

### 9. Documentation
- **Framework Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on framework usage
- **Coding Standards**: Clear guidelines for test development
- **Maintenance Guide**: Instructions for framework maintenance and updates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Framework Setup
- Set up project structure
- Implement core dependencies
- Create base classes and utilities
- Establish configuration management

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement Page Object Model
- Set up test data management
- Integrate Playwright with Pytest
- Configure basic reporting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
